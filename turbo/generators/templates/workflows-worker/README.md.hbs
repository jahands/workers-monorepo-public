# {{ slug name }}

Build with Workflows!

## Structure

- `src/workflows/{{ slug workflowName }}` - Initial Workflow in the Worker. Can add multiple!

## Setup

After creating a Worker from this template, be sure to do the following steps:

1. Change route in `wrangler.toml` if needed (defaults to `{{ slug name }}.workflows.uuid.rocks`)
2. Add domain to the Worker in the Cloudflare dashboard
3. Consider adding dedicated api token in `workflows-helpers/src/auth.ts`
